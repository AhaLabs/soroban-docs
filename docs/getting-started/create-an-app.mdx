title: 5. Create an App
description: Make a frontend web app that interacts with your smart contracts.
---

With two smart contracts deployed to a public network, you can now create a web app that interacts with them via RPC calls. Let's get started.

## Initialize a frontend toolchain

You can build a Soroban app with any frontend toolchain or integrate it into any existing full-stack app. For this tutorial, we're going to use [Astro](https://astro.build/). Astro works with React, Vue, Svelte, any other UI library, or no UI library at all. In this tutorial, we're not using a UI library. The Soroban-specific parts of this tutorial will be similar no matter what frontend toolchain you use.

If you're new to frontend, don't worry. We won't go too deep. But it will be useful for you to see and experience the frontend development process used by Soroban apps. We'll cover the relevant bits of JavaScript and Astro, but teaching all of frontend development and Astro is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

Let's get started.

You're going to need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) v18.14.1 or greater. If you haven't yet, install it now.

There are several project organization strategies, but we find it to be the simplest to have Node-specific web app code live right alongside the Rust-specific smart contract code, at the root of an Astro project.

Astro's project initializer allows us to pass in a `template` argument. If we use our tutorial repository as a template, it will create a project that includes our `hello-soroban` and `incrementor` contracts, a Cargo.toml for the workspace, and npm scripts to generate the appropriate typescript clients to interact with the contracts.

So let's go ahead and do that. From `soroban-tutorial`'s parent directory, run:

```sh
npm create astro@latest astro-soroban-tutorial -- --template AhaLabs/soroban-tutorial-project#template --no-git --no-install --typescript strictest
```

The template provides all we need for a new project. However, since we already did the work of deploying our contracts to Testnet, and storing their ids in the `.soroban` directory, let's copy those files over to our new project so that we can reuse them. From the parent directory of both `astro-soroban-tutorial` and `soroban-tutorial`, run:

```bash
cp -r ./soroban-tutorial/.soroban ./astro-soroban-tutorial
```

We will be working from the `astro-soroban-tutorial` directory for the rest of this tutorial, so it is safe to delete the original `soroban-tutorial` if you want: `rm -rf soroban-tutorial`.

## Generate an NPM package for the Hello World contract

Before we even open the new frontend files, let's generate an NPM package for the Hello Soroban contract. This is our suggested way to interact with contracts from frontends. These generated libraries work with any JavaScript project (not a specific UI like React), and make it easy to work with some of the trickiest bits of Soroban, like encoding [XDR](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/fully-typed-contracts).

This is going to use the CLI command `soroban contract bindings typescript`. From the `astro-soroban-tutorial` directory, run

```bash
soroban contract bindings typescript \
  --network testnet \
  --contract-id $(cat .soroban/hello-id) \
  --output-dir node_modules/hello-soroban-client
```

:::note

The template includes an npm script that wraps this CLI command which may be more convenient to use: `npm run bindings:hello`.

:::

We attempt to keep the code in these generated libraries readable, so go ahead and look around. Open up the new `node_modules/hello-soroban-client` directory in your editor. If you've built or contributed to Node projects, it will all look familiar. You'll see a `package.json` file, a `src` directory, a `tsconfig.json`, and even a README. The README is a great place to start. Go ahead and give it a read.

As it says, when using local libraries, we've had the [most success](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp/pull/117#discussion_r1232873560) when generating them directly into the `node_modules` folder, and leaving them out of the `dependencies` section. Yes, this is surprising, but it works the best.

The template adds several scripts in the `package.json` file, including a `postinstall` script that calls `bindings:hello` after every install to make sure that the generated library stays up-to-date.

Let's run `npm install` now to make sure that all of our dependencies are installed, and note that the `postinstall` script will also run.

### Call the contract from the frontend

Now let's open up `src/pages/index.astro` and take a look at the code that calls the hello-soroban contract using the generated library:

```typescript title="src/pages/index.astro"
 ---
import { Contract, networks } from 'hello-soroban-client';

const greeter = new Contract({
  ...networks.testnet,
  rpcUrl: 'https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org', // from https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/reference/rpc#public-rpc-providers
});

const greeting = await greeter.hello({ to: 'Soroban' });
 ---
```

Then the greeting is displayed in the first `<h1>` tag:

```typescript title="src/pages/index.astro"
<h1>
  <span class="text-gradient">{greeting.join(" ")}</span>
</h1>
```

Now start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser. You should see the greeting from the contract!

You can try updating the `{ to: 'Soroban' }` argument. When you save the file, the page will automatically update.

### What's happening here?

If you inspect the page (right-click, inspect) and refresh, you'll see a couple interesting things:

- The "Network" tab shows that there are no Fetch/XHR requests made. But RPC calls happen via Fetch/XHR! So how is the frontend calling the contract?
- There's no JavaScript on the page. But we just wrote some JavaScript! How is it working?

This is part of Astro's philosophy: the frontend should ship with as few assets as possible. Preferably zero JavaScript. When you put JavaScript in the [frontmatter](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/), Astro will run it at build time, and then replace anything in the `{...}` curly brackets with the output.

When using the development server with `npm run dev`, it runs the frontmatter code on the server, and injects the resulting values into the page on the client.

You can try building to see this more dramatically:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then check the `dist` folder. You'll see that it built an HTML and CSS file, but no JavaScript. And if you look at the HTML file, you'll see a static "Hello Soroban" in the `<h1>`.

During the build, Astro made a single call to your contract, then injected the static result into the page. This is great for contract methods that don't change, but probably won't work for most contract methods. Let's integrate with the `incrementor` contract to see how to handle interactive methods in Astro.

## Call the incrementor contract from the frontend

While `hello` is a simple view-only/read method, `increment` changes on-chain state. This means that someone needs to sign the transaction. So we'll need to add transaction-signing capabilities to the frontend.

The way signing works in a browser is with a _wallet_. Wallets can be web apps, browser extensions, standalone apps, or even separate hardware devices.

Right now, the wallet that best supports Soroban is [Freighter](../reference/freighter.mdx). It is available as a Firefox Add-on, as well as extensions for Chrome and Brave. Go ahead and [install it now](https://freighter.app).

Once it's installed, open it up by clicking the extension icon. If this is your first time using Freighter, you will need to create a new wallet. Go through the prompts to create a password and save your recovery passphrase.

Go to Settings (the gear icon) â†’ Preferences and toggle the switch to Enable Experimental Mode. Then go back to its home screen and select "Test Net" from the top-right dropdown. Finally, if it shows the message that your Stellar address is not funded, go ahead and click the "Fund with Friendbot" button.

Now you're all set up to use Freighter as a user, and you can use it in your app.

### Use Freighter

We're going to add a "Connect" button to the page that opens Freighter and prompts the user to give your web page permission to use Freighter. Once they grant this permission, the "Connect" button will be replaced with a message saying, "Signed in as [their public key]".

First, double check that [@stellar/freighter-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/freighter-api) is in package.json as a dependency.

Take a look at the `ConnectFreighter` component in the `src/components` directory:

```html title="src/components/ConnectFreighter.astro"
<div id="freighter-wrap" class="wrap" aria-live="polite">
  <div class="ellipsis">
    <button data-connect aria-controls="freighter-wrap">Connect</button>
  </div>
</div>

<style>
  .wrap {
    text-align: center;
  }

  .ellipsis {
    line-height: 2.7rem;
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 12rem;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    text-align: center;
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
</style>

<script>
  import { isAllowed, setAllowed, getUserInfo } from '@stellar/freighter-api';

  const wrap = document.querySelector('#freighter-wrap');
  const ellipsis = document.querySelector('#freighter-wrap .ellipsis');
  const button = document.querySelector('[data-connect]');

  async function getPk() {
    const { publicKey } = await getUserInfo();
    return publicKey;
  }

  async function setLoggedIn() {
    const publicKey = await getPk();
    ellipsis.innerHTML = `Signed in as ${publicKey}`;
    ellipsis.title = publicKey;
  }

  if (await isAllowed()) {
    if (await getPk()) setLoggedIn();
    else wrap.innerHTML = 'Freighter is locked.<br>Sign in & refresh the page.';
  } else {
    button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
      button.disabled = true;
      await setAllowed();
      await setLoggedIn();
    });
  }
</script>
```

Some of this may look surprising. `<style>` and `<script>` tags in the middle of the page? Uncreative class names like `wrap`? `import` statements in a `<script>`? Top-level `await`? What's going on here?

Astro automatically scopes the styles within a component to that component, so there's no reason for us to come up with a clever names for our classes.

And all the `script` declarations get bundled together and included intelligently in the page. Even if you use the same component multiple times, the script will only be included once. And yes, you can use top-level `await`.

You can read more about this in [Astro's page about client-side scripts](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/).

The code itself here is pretty self-explanatory. We import a few methods from `@stellar/freighter-api` to check if the user is logged in. If they already are, then `isAllowed` returns `true`. If it's been more than a day since they've used the Freighter extension, then the `publicKey` will be blank, so we tell them to unlock Freighter and refresh the page. If `isAllowed` and the `publicKey` both look good, we replace the contents of the `div` with the signed-in message, replacing the button. Otherwise, we add a click handler to the button to prompt the user to connect Freighter with `setAllowed`. Once they do, we again replace the contents of the `div` with the signed-in message. The [`aria` stuff](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) ensures that screen readers will read the new contents when they're updated.

Now we can import the component in the frontmatter of `pages/index.astro`:

```diff title="pages/index.astro"
 ---
 import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
 import Card from '../components/Card.astro';
+import ConnectFreighter from '../components/ConnectFreighter.astro';
 import { Contract, networks } from 'hello-soroban-client';
 ...
```

And add it right below the `<h1>`:

```diff title="pages/index.astro"
 <h1><span class="text-gradient">{greeting.join(' ')}</span></h1>
+<ConnectFreighter />
```

If you're no longer running your dev server, go ahead and restart it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the page and click the "Connect" button. You should see Freighter pop up and ask you to sign in. Once you do, the button should be replaced with a message saying, "Signed in as [your public key]".

Now you're ready to sign the call to `increment`!

### Call `increment`

We're going to generate a client for the incrementor contract with a similar command to the one we used before. Let's add a script for generating a client for the incrementor to `package.json`, and call them both from `postinstall` using a double ampersand ([&&](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25669618/249801)):

```diff title="package.json"
 "bindings:hello": "soroban contract bindings typescript --network testnet --contract-id $(cat .soroban/hello-id) --output-dir node_modules/hello-soroban-client",
+"bindings:incrementor": "soroban contract bindings typescript --network testnet --contract-id $(cat .soroban/incrementor-id) --output-dir node_modules/incrementor-client",
-"postinstall": "if [ ! -d .soroban ]; then npm run setup; fi && npm run bindings:hello"
+"postinstall": "if [ ! -d .soroban ]; then npm run setup; fi && npm run bindings:hello && npm run bindings:incrementor"
```

Reinstall the dependencies to also run `postinstall`:

```bash
npm i
```

Now we can import from `incrementor-client` and start using in a new Astro component. Add a new file at `src/components/Counter.astro` with the following contents:

```html title="src/components/Counter.astro"
<strong>Incrementor</strong><br />
Current value: <strong id="current-value" aria-live="polite">???</strong><br />
<br />
<button data-increment aria-controls="current-value">Increment</button>

<script>
  import { Contract, networks } from "incrementor-client";

  const incrementor = new Contract({
    ...networks.testnet,
    rpcUrl: "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org", // from https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/reference/rpc-list#sdf-futurenet-and-testnet-only
  });

  const button = document.querySelector("[data-increment]");
  const currentValue = document.querySelector("#current-value");

  button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
    button.disabled = true;
    button.classList.add("loading");
    currentValue.innerHTML =
      currentValue.innerHTML +
      '<span class="visually-hidden"> â€“Â updatingâ€¦</span>';

    const newValue = await incrementor.increment();

    // Only use `innerHTML` with contract values you trust!
    // Blindly using values from an untrusted contract opens your users to script injection attacks!
    currentValue.innerHTML = newValue;

    button.disabled = false;
    button.classList.remove("loading");
  });
</script>
```

This should be somewhat familiar by now. We have a `script` that, thanks to Astro's build system, can `import` modules directly. We use `document.querySelector` to find the elements defined above. And we add a `click` handler to the button, which calls `increment` and updates the value on the page. It also sets the button to `disabled` and adds a `loading` class while the call is in progress to prevent the user from clicking it again and visually communicate that something is happening. For people using screen readers, the loading state is communicated with the [visually-hidden](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/) span, which will be announced to them thanks to the `aria` tags we saw before.

Also, notice that you don't need to manually specify Freighter as the wallet in the call to `increment`. This may change in the future, but while Freighter is the only game in town, these generated libraries automatically use it. If you want to override this behavior, you can pass a `wallet` option; check the latest `Wallet` interface in [the template source](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-tools/blob/main/cmd/crates/soroban-spec-typescript/src/project_template/src/method-options.ts) for details.

Now let's use this component. In `pages/index.astro`, first import it:

```diff title="pages/index.astro"
 ---
 import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
 import Card from '../components/Card.astro';
 import ConnectFreighter from '../components/ConnectFreighter.astro';
+import Counter from '../components/Counter.astro';
 import { Contract, networks } from "hello-soroban-client";
 ...
```

Then use it. Let's replace the contents of the `instructions` paragraph with it:

```diff title="pages/index.astro"
 <p class="instructions">
-  To get started, open the directory <code>src/pages</code> in your project.<br />
-  <strong>Code Challenge:</strong> Tweak the "Welcome to Astro" message above.
+  <Counter />
 </p>
```

Check the page; if you're still running your dev server, it should have already updated. Click the "Increment" button; you should see a Freighter confirmation. Confirm, and... the value updates! ðŸŽ‰

There's obviously some functionality missing, though. For example, that `???` is a bummer. But our `incrementor` contract doesn't give us a way to query the current value without also updating it.

Before you try to update it, let's streamline the process around building, deploying, and generating clients for contracts.

## Streamlining the dev process

There are several other scripts added to package.json that have been added to make this project easier to work with. Let's take a look at those scripts now.

First, let's look at the `clean` script which removes the `.soroban` directory to make it easy to go back to how collaborators will experience this repository when they first clone it. It will also remove the `node_modules/.vite` directory, which is where Astro caches its build artifacts ([Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool [used by Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#vite)).

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rm -rf .soroban node_modules/.vite",
  ...
}
```

Next, let's look at the `setup` script which builds your contracts, then checks if the `.soroban` folder is present, and if not, creates and funds the `alice` identity and deploys your contracts. This is a lot for a single NPM script, so we've broken it into a few to make it a little more legible.

```json title="package.json"
  "scripts": {
    ...
   "create_deployer": "soroban config identity generate alice && soroban config identity fund alice --network testnet",
   "deploy:hello": "soroban contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_soroban.wasm --source alice --network testnet > .soroban/hello-id",
   "deploy:incrementor": "soroban contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/incrementor.wasm --source alice --network testnet > .soroban/incrementor-id;",
   "deploy": "npm run deploy:hello && npm run deploy:incrementor",
   "setup": "soroban contract build && if [ ! -d .soroban ]; then npm run create_deployer && npm run deploy; fi",
    ...
  }
```

Finally, let's there is a `reset` script that calls both in order:

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
    ...
    "reset": "npm run clean && npm run setup",
    ...
}
```

Now anytime you make changes to your contracts, you can run `npm run reset` to build the new contracts, deploy them, and install dependencies. And, of course, installing dependencies will run `postinstall`, which will also regenerate the contract client libraries directly to the `node_modules` folder.

The `postinstall` script also checks for the existence of `.soroban` and automatically runs `npm run setup` if it's not found:

```json title="package.json"
  "postinstall": "if [ ! -d .soroban ]; then npm run setup; fi && npm run bindings:hello && npm run bindings:incrementor",
```

## Take it further

If you want to take it a bit further and make sure you understand all the pieces here, try the following:

- Make a `src/contracts` folder with a `greeter.ts` and an `incrementor.ts`. Move the `new Contract({ ... })` logic into those files. You may also want to extract the `rpcUrl` variable to a `src/contracts/utils.ts` file.
- Add a `get_value` method to the `incrementor` contract, and use it to display the current value in the `Counter` component. (Remember to run `npm run reset` after you make changes to the contract!)
- Add a "Decrement" button to the `Counter` component. This will again require a change to the `incrementor` contract, and another `npm run reset`.
- [Deploy](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) your frontend. You can do this quickly and for free [with GitHub](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/). If you get stuck installing soroban-cli and deploying contracts on GitHub, check out [how we did this](https://github.com/AhaLabs/soroban-tutorial-project/commit/c1f4cfde1bbaf059507100767ee6b43d29b42914).
- Rather than using NPM scripts for everything, try using a more elegant script runner such as [just](https://github.com/casey/just). The existing npm `scripts` can then call `just`, such as `"setup": "just setup"`.
- Update the README to explain what this project is and how to use it to potential collaborators and employers ðŸ˜‰

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes things go wrong. As a first step when troubleshooting, you may want to [clone our tutorial repository](https://github.com/AhaLabs/soroban-tutorial-project) and see if the problem happens there, too. If it happens there, too, then it may be a temporary problem with the Soroban network.

Here are some common issues and how to fix them.

### Contract client libraries are removed when adding new dependencies

When adding new dependencies to your project via `npm`, you may run into a issue where `npm install [new dependency]` doesn't run the `postinstall` hook the way that `npm install` does. But it does run the cleanup logic, which will remove "incorrect" folders. It considers our contract client libraries (e.g. `node_modules/hello-soroban-client`) "incorrect", since they're not in the dependencies in `package.json`. So you either need to run `npm i` (a shortcut for `npm install`), or `postinstall` directly to make sure that they are re-built:

```bash
npm run postinstall

```

### Call to `hello` fails

Sometimes the call to `hello` can start failing. You can obviously stub out the call and define `greeting` some other way to troubleshoot.

One of the common problems here is that the contract [expires](../fundamentals-and-concepts/state-expiration.mdx). To check if this is the problem, you can re-run `npm run reset`.

If you're still having problems, join our Discord (link above) or [open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-docs/issues/new/choose).

### All contract calls start throwing `403` errors

This means that Testnet is down, and you probably just need to wait a while and try again.

## Wrapping up

Looking at `git diff` will be a great way to remember all the interesting things we did in this step. Some of the things we did:

- We learned about Astro's no-JS-by-default approach
- We added Astro components and learned how their `script` and `style` tags work
- We saw how easy it is to interact with Soroban contracts from JavaScript by generating client libraries using `soroban contract bindings typescript`
- We learned about wallets and Freighter

At this point, you've seen a full end-to-end example of building on Soroban! What's next? You choose! You can:

- See more complex example contracts in the [Basic Tutorials](/docs/category/basic-tutorials) and [Advanced Tutorials](/docs/category/advanced-tutorials) sections.
- Learn more about the [fundamentals and concepts](/docs/category/fundamentals-and-concepts) of Soroban.
- Check out a more full-featured [example app](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp), which uses React rather than vanilla JavaScript and Next.js rather than Astro. This app also has a more complex setup & initialization process, with the option of using a [locally-hosted RPC node](../reference/rpc.mdx).
